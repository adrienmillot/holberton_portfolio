# First Week Progress

For this first week, we have estimated that our progress could be `rated 8 over 10`, we are measuring it by what we needed to do before the deadlines that we gave ourselves. Before Tuesday 14/10/2021, we intended to have functional models, database storage and that we could start to send request to our API entrypoints. We added some late functionalities like export in CSV and JSON.

The only part where we are a little late is the web interface that we've just started, in order to stay in time Simon will work on web interface with Nathan in direct help, and Adrien for complex problematic. The goal is to provide a web visual for Wednesday 20/10/2021.

# Second Week Progress

For the second week, we have estimated that our progress could be `rated 7 over 10`, we have done all API models entrypoints and a first functional web interface with a majority of elements. We intended to have our MVP for Wednesday 20/10/2021, with all functional API entrypoints and a web interface to present.

For the next week, Adrien will start working on the mobile interface, Nathan on updating the API functionalities and statistics and will be in direct help for Simon that will enhanced the web interface and the statistics graphics rendering.
