## First week challenges
The First challenge we had to face, something that's happen so often we don't think at it first. The very first thing was having a personal working environment working without any problems. That one fixed we faced our second challenge. Now we do need to have one common development environment. We fixed that problem with Docker, with we can simulate the same environment for the three of us. Then we, of course, face the challenge to understand and use new things, never used before. Like how to encrypt password in the database with Bcrypt encryption or how to use token authentification.

The principle plan we had to change was our time planning. All this unearthed challenges took us time to fix. that time was plan to develop the project so we had to do extra hours to take that time back. But extra hours lead to other new challenges, those one were not technical.

So the first nonthecnical challenge was our time management, between the not planned technical problem who were eating our time and the development of some part of the project who were tacking more time than planned. We often have to add extra hours of work to stay in what was planified. So far we where lucky enough to not change what was plan in the project, but start to think about it. That something which could happened again in the futur of the project development, asking ourself if we keep going the way we planned, or if we stop, go a litle backward and change some part of the plan to do something more reachable for us in therme of actual knowlege and the time we alowed to.
The other problems we had to face is the moral of each members of the team, sometimes the entire team, that interact with the capacity and the quality of the produced work. Beeing all ready and at 100% of our capacity at the same time is not something that easy.
