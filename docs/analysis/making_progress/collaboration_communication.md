# Collaboration/Communication

## Challenges

### Moral of collaborators management

In a team, we are not all efficient at the same time. For the development of a project we must take it into account.

We had discussed our vision for the project beforehand. But we must necessarily adapt to the unforeseen (a person who blocks on a problem, agendas that do not agree, etc ...).

### Tests

For this project, we've chosen technologies that we had already used. But we also decided to integrate new features (bcrypt, token, etc ...). For our tests, therefore, it took us longer. 

## Success

### Team collaboration

Over the course of a year, the three of us got to know each other. We pretty much knew how each one works. This made our work much easier when collaborating in the project. 

### Time management

Before launching into the project, we had already started to estimate the big tasks with which we should start. So we already had an estimation of how long each task would take us. We had consulted together to estimate this time. This allowed us to estimate more reliably.
